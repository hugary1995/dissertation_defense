      Conclusions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{5pt}
        \item A variational framework is proposed to model \textcolor{peggyblue}{general dissipative solids with fracture}.
        \item Several models are constructed within the framework to study \textcolor{peggyblue}{practical engineering problems}:
              \begin{itemize}
                \setlength\itemsep{3pt}
                \item \underline{Intergranular fracture:} brittle fracture, quasi-brittle fracture, fragmentation, pressurized cracks;
                \item \underline{Soil desiccation:} cohesive fracture, traction-free BCs, random fracture properties;
                \item \underline{Ductile failure:} no re-calibration, regularization-independent response (J-resistance curves), thermal effects, three-point bending, the Sandia Fracture Challenge, oxide spallation in HTHX.

      Future work:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Fracture \textcolor{peggyblue}{nucleation with arbitrary strength surface}.
        \item Ductile failure with \textcolor{peggyblue}{impact loading}, where dynamic effects, abrupt thermal softening, and heat generation are important.
        \item \textcolor{peggyblue}{Fatigue} effects are important in structures subject to cyclic loading. Existing fatigue models do not fit into the framework as is. The interplay between fatigue and plasticity could be interesting.
